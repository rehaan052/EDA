## Executive Summary

### Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to explore and understand patterns that drive customer churn, especially focusing on key variables like contract types, payment methods, tenure, and demographics. The insights are aimed at helping build data-backed retention strategies and informing future machine learning models for churn prediction.

# Key Insights & Interpretations
1. Contract Type and Churn**
* About 42% of customers on month-to-month contracts have churned, making them the highest-risk group.
* In comparison, only 11% on one-year contracts and just 3% on two-year contracts have churned.
  **Takeaway**: Longer contracts clearly reduce churn. Offering discounts or loyalty perks to encourage users to switch from monthly to annual contracts could help retain customers.
2. Payment Method and Churn**
* Electronic check users have the highest churn rate at 45%.
* Users paying via credit card, bank transfer, or mailed check show churn rates between 15% to 18%.
  **Takeaway**: This may be due to trust, reliability, or convenience concerns with electronic checks. Encouraging secure, automatic payment methods (like credit cards or autopay) could reduce churn.
3. Tenure and Churn**
* Customers with less than 1 year of tenure churn the most — around 50%.
* For those with 1–3 years, the churn rate drops to 35%.
* For more than 3 years, it drops further to 15%.
  **Takeaway**: The early phase of customer onboarding is critical. Engaging users with offers, personalized messages, and helpful support in their first year can increase retention.
4. Internet Service Type**
* Fiber optic users churn at a rate of 30%, which is noticeably higher than DSL users at 20%.
  **Takeaway**: Despite being faster, fiber services might have issues like higher costs or technical problems. Collecting user feedback and addressing these concerns can help improve satisfaction.
*5. Senior Citizens and Churn**
* Seniors (age 65 and above) churn at a rate of 41%, compared to 26% among non-seniors.
  **Takeaway**: The higher churn among seniors might relate to tech-related challenges or lack of support. Simplifying processes and providing dedicated assistance could help retain this group.

|                | Non-Seniors                 | 26%        |

Visuals like bar plots and line charts were used to present these patterns. They clearly show that churn decreases with longer contracts and higher tenure. The payment method visuals highlighted the particularly high churn from electronic check users.

### Recommendations

**1. Promote Long-Term Contracts**
Encourage users to switch from month-to-month to yearly contracts with discounts, rewards, or loyalty points.

**2. Shift Away from Electronic Checks**
Run campaigns or provide incentives to shift customers to more secure, automated payment methods.

**3. Improve Onboarding for New Customers**
Build early engagement strategies like personalized greetings, offers, and support during the first year.

**4. Enhance Support for Fiber Optic Users**
Conduct feedback surveys, troubleshoot common issues, and offer value-added services to retain high-speed internet users.

**5. Make Services More Senior-Friendly**
Provide printed instructions, simplified billing, and dedicated customer service for older customers.

### Final Thoughts

This analysis lays the groundwork for building a churn prediction model and shaping stronger retention strategies. A logical next step is to feed these findings into a machine learning model using algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost. These models can help predict churn probability and personalize intervention for at-risk customers.
